This Algorithm uses pseudo random numbers to encrypt and decrypt data. 
I thought  up this algorithm after I took a cryptography class in college.
This project was completed during summer vacation my junior year of Champlain college. 

File format for Encryption/Decryption:
tested with 
	-.txt
	-.md
	-.bin
	-.doc
	-File	
Not work with
	-.docx 
	-.rtf
	
Warning:
	For the file to be found it either 
	 -has to be in the same folder as the .exe
	 -or give the full file path of the file 
	

Warning:
	-Sometimes when a single quote is copied, it isn't a single quote that is recognized.
	-When the algorithm doesn't recognize a character a new line replaces it.
	-Algorithm doesn't recognize tabs.
